# Guide to Using the Google Colab Notebook for LLaVA Demonstration

## Introduction

This guide will help you launch and use a Google Colab notebook to demonstrate the capabilities of the LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) model. The notebook allows you to upload images and receive text-based answers from the model based on visual content analysis.

## Step 1: Open the Notebook in Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account if you haven’t already
3. Select **File → Upload notebook**
4. Upload the file `llava_demo.ipynb` provided to you

## Step 2: Set Up the Runtime Environment

To run LLaVA effectively, GPU usage is recommended:

1. In the top menu, select **Runtime → Change runtime type**
2. In the dialog that appears, set:
   - Runtime type: **Python 3**
   - Hardware accelerator: **GPU**
3. Click **Save**

## Step 3: Run the Notebook Cells

Run the notebook cells one by one, following the instructions inside:

1. Install required libraries (may take 2–3 minutes)
2. Clone the LLaVA repository (about 1 minute)
3. Load the LLaVA model (may take 5–10 minutes depending on internet speed)
4. Define functions for image processing
5. Launch the Gradio interactive interface

## Step 4: Use the Interactive Interface

Once the Gradio interface is launched, you’ll see a web UI with the following components:

1. **Image upload area** – click to upload an image from your computer  
2. **Text input field** – type a question or instruction for the model  
3. **Temperature slider** – controls creativity of the response (0.0 = more deterministic, 1.0 = more diverse)  
4. **Max tokens slider** – limits the length of the response  
5. **"Submit" button** – click to get a response from the model

## Step 5: Usage Examples

The notebook includes usage examples with a preloaded image:

1. Image description  
2. Spatial reasoning  
3. Complex reasoning  

You can run these examples to see how the model analyzes the image and answers various types of questions.

## Step 6: Upload Your Own Image

In the final part of the notebook, you can upload your own image and ask a question:

1. Run the code cell for image upload  
2. Choose a file from your computer  
3. Enter your question or instruction in the input field  
4. Receive a response from the model

## Possible Issues and Solutions

1. **CUDA out of memory error**: Reduce image size or restart the runtime  
2. **Slow model loading**: Check your internet connection or rerun the cell  
3. **Dependency installation error**: Rerun the installation cell or restart the runtime

## Additional Notes

- The notebook uses the **LLaVA-1.5-7B** model due to Google Colab resource constraints. For better quality, a 13B version can be used, but it requires more computing power.
- The Gradio interface provides a temporary public link, which you can share with others (valid for ~72 hours).
- Don’t forget to save your work by creating a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive (File → Save a copy in Drive).
